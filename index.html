          <p>I was reading this <a href="https://medium.com/jigsaw/what-could-bg-be-enabling-a-large-scale-conversation-in-kentucky-70071f4fe268">article from Jigsaw</a>, a Google organization focused on factuality and media.

While this use-case is interesting, we always have to wonder what the implications of technology are 10 years from now in the hands of less benevolent people.</p>
